## Task description:

This is my first experiment with django, where I have been practicing to initialize the project and the app, configure setting and url files, create and manage static content at development and production stages, create and manage templates. I have built a simple python function to calculate how many days are left until the next Halloween (31st of October), using the datetime module and plugged the return value of this function into my HTML template using django template system language syntax. 

You will see a Happy Halloween message on the 31st of October or how many days are left until Halloween on any other day.
